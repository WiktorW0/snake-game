# Snake game

[Demo Page](https://wiktorw0.github.io/snake-game/)

***Snake game build as a part of [JavaScript Full Course for free 🌐 (2023)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dWL3wF_OMw) made by [Bro Code](https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez).***
</br>
***One of the games made throughout the course while learning basics of JavaScript with tweaks done by myself. Changed behaviour of the snake to make it more like in the original game and added more colisions mostly with the apple so it cannot spawn inside the snake.***
